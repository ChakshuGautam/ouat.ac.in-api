   "general_advisory": "Rice grains must be dried under sun for 3-4 days to 14% moisture for consumption and 12% moisture for seed purpose. There will be chances of infestation of sucking pests, leaf blight, powdery mildew in the crops and vegetables due to low night temperature. Monitor the crops and vegetables and take appropriate plant protection measures. Complete transplanting of winter vegetable crops. Use low-cost polythene cover above the vegetables nursery to avoid poor germination due to low temperature. Harvest the mature sugarcanes below one inch of ground level for a successful ratoon crop.",
