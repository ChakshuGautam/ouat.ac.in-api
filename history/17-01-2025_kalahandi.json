Install yellow sticky trap @ 8/acre to monitor sucking pest like White fly, Aphids, Jassids & Thirps in vegetables at vegetative stage. Regular monitoring of the crop for incidence of pest and diseases should be done and use light trap to monitor insect population so that timely control measure can be taken. For making a light trap, a bulb should be fixed above a container (either plastic or tin) having a mixture of water and few drops of any insecticide. The insects get attracted towards the light, fall in the solution and die. Always apply recommended dose of pesticide in correct method during morning or afternoon hours and pay attention to the wind direction during application. Install 3 pheromone traps/acre to monitor pest population of stem borer and leaf folder soon after rice transplanting.",
