There is a chance of increase in various disease infestation in both field as well as vegetable crops.

            "If rice is at maturity stage, stop irrigation in the field before harvesting. Harvest the plants when 80-85% of the grains have matured and the plant looks pale yellow in color. After harvesting rice should be dried in the field for 2-3 days and thereafter threshing should be done. Rice should be stored at a moisture level of 12% in safe places. Due to low night temperature and high humidity, there may be a chance of False Smut disease infestation in late maturing rice varieties so regular monitoring should be advised. If infestation is noticed, then spraying of Copper hydroxide 77% @ 2g/ltr or Tebuconazole 25% @ 2g/ltr should be advised. Repeat the spray after 7-10 days for its effective control."

Antibiotic treatment and consultation should be made with a qualified veterinary Doctor."
