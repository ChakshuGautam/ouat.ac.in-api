It is optimum time for sowing of Vegetables like cole crops (Cabbage, late Cauliflower and Broccoli), Solanaceous vegetables (Brinjal, Tomato, Chilli and Capsicum). Go for planting of vegetables like Carrot, radish, late onion, garlic, legumes, etc. October is the ideal time for hard pruning in rose to produce lots of flower buds on a well-spaced framework of branches. Go for nursery sowing of brinjal, tomato, cauliflower and sesame. Go for planting of cole crops. Cole crop seedlings are at 3-week stage in the nursery. Go for planting in the main field.
