   "general_advisory": "Farmers are advised to do weeding and hoeing in the standing crops like Maize, Groundnut, Green gram, Chick pea and vegetables to protect them from weeds. Apply balanced and appropriate fertilizers according to cropâ€™s growth stage. Install yellow sticky trap @ 8/acre to monitor sucking pest like White fly, Aphids, Jassids & Thirps in vegetables at vegetative stage. Rouging of viral infested plant should be done in vegetables. Infected plants should be uprooted and buried in the soil. After rouging, if infection is more, then spraying of Imidacloprid @ 1 ml per 3 -4 litres of water is advised to control the vector. Use pheromone trap @ 8/acre for monitoring borer insect in vegetables like brinjal, cauliflower, cabbage, tomato etc. To control early and late blight in tomato field spray Azoxystrobin 23% SC @ 1 ml/litre of water or Zineb 75% WP @ 2.5 g/litre of water.",
