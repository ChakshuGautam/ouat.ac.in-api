   "general_advisory": "Based on the above forecast farmers can now resume intercultural operations, fertilization and spraying of plant protection chemical with sticker as required. Considering the realized and anticipated rainfall, farmers are advised to complete the transplanting of paddy by 15th of August. Farmers are advised not to apply fertilizer and herbicides in rice field when there is no sufficient soil moisture. Make arrangements for draining out excess water from the field of Pulses, Maize, Groundnut and vegetables. Due to the prevailing cloudy weather associated with high humidity, regular monitoring for occurrence of insects and diseases in crops is highly recommended. Install light trap in crop fields to monitor insect population so that timely control measure can be taken. Apply Emamectin Benzoate 5% SG @ 80 g/acre by mixing with 200 liters of water to control FAW infestation in maize.",
