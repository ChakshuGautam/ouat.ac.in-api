   "general_advisory": "As per extended range of forecast received from IMD, fairly widespread rain/thundershower is very likely over districts of Odisha during the week-1 (6th - 12th September, 2024) with isolated heavy rainfall very likely in the districts of South Odisha on 6th Sept; isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall very likely in the districts of South Odisha on 7th Sept; isolated heavy to very heavy rainfall very likely in the districts of Central Odisha on 8th Sept, heavy rainfall very likely over the districts of north Odisha on 9th and 10th Sept. Scattered to fairly widespread rain/thundershower very likely in the district of Odisha state during week 2 (13th - 19th September, 2024). In view of five days weather forecast received from IMD, farmers are advised to withhold application of fertilizers and plant protection chemicals for the time being. Apply balanced and appropriate fertilizers according to cropâ€™s growth stage. Avoid excess nitrogen as it promotes excessive vegetative growth and increase water demand. Always consider an integrated approach of preventive measures together with biological treatment if available to protect the crop from pests. Extensive insecticide use can lead to resistance in the pest. To prevent this, ensure proper rotation between insecticides and use mixtures. Use light trap to monitor insect population so that timely control measure can be taken. SMS Advisory: Apply Urea @ 25kg/ac if crop is at tasseling stage (9 week) in Maize.",
