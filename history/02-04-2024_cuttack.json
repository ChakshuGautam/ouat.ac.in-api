Mulch coconut leaves around coconut trees. Cover newly planted vegetable seedlings with paper caps during the day. Harvest fingerlings in shallow ponds if water temperature rises. Manage Yellow Stem Borer in paddy crop. Manage blast disease in paddy. Manage tobacco caterpillar in black gram and green gram. Manage early shoot borer in sugarcane. Manage brinjal shoot and fruit borer. Prevent whitefly infestation in okra. Properly store harvested onions. Control mango hoppers in mango trees.",
