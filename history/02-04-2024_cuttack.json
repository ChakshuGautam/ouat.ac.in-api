Cover with paper caps on newly planted vegetable seedlings. Harvest fingerlings in shallow ponds if water temperature rises. Yellow stem borer management in paddy. Blast disease management. Tobacco caterpillar management in black gram & green gram. Early shoot borer management in sugarcane. Brinjal shoot and fruit borer management. Whitefly infestation prevention in okra.
