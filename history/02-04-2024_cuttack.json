Apply sprinkler irrigation to bring down the heat effect. Irrigate the maize crop to prevent water scarcity. Spread polythene in irrigation channels in sandy and loamy soils to save water wastage. Apply Streptocyclin in tomato and brinjal. Mulch coconut leaves around a coconut tree to reduce water loss. Cover vegetable seedlings with paper caps during daytime. Harvest fingerlings in shallow ponds if water temperature rises to 30°C.",
