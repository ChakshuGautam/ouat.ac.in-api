Apply sprinkler irrigation to bring down the heat effect. High temperature increases the water requirement of maize crop. Spread polythene in irrigation channels to save water wastage. Mulch coconut leaves to reduce water loss. Harvest fingerlings in shallow ponds if water temperature rises. For better agricultural benefits, use OUAT KALINGA products.",
