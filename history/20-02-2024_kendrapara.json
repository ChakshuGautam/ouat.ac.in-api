   "general_advisory": "Transplanting of summer paddy is continuing. Sowing of summer pulses, oilseed and vegetables are also in progress. Mustard, Til and Groundnut are in harvesting stage. Harvesting of rabi paira pulses like Mung, Biri and Kulthi are continuing. Planting of Sugarcane is under progress. Crop coverage till date is 86% of the total programme area. Overall crop condition is Normal. February-March is the ideal time for sowing of Cowpea, Cluster bean, Pumpkin, Cucumber and Watermelon. Transplanting of vegetables should be done in afternoon hour to avoid high temperature. Harvest the mustard crop as soon as the pods turn yellowish-brown. The crop is liable to shattering, hence it should be harvested just before the pods open to avoid losses. Harvest the potato crop which are at 75-85 days after planting and when majority of the leaves turn yellowish brown. For harvesting stop the irrigation 15 days before. To manage Tobacco Caterpillar pest in Groundnut, Blackgram, Greengram during primary stages of pest infestation proper surveillance should be done to collect and destroy egg mass and caterpillar of the pest. Monitor the emergence of adult moths by setting up Pheromone traps having Spodolure @ 6-8 nos/acre. Check the migration of caterpillars by dusting with Chlorpyriphos 1.5 % D @ 10 kg around the field.",
