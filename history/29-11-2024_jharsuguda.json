There is a chance of increase in various disease infestation in both field as well as vegetable crops due to prevailing weather condition so regular monitoring against these diseases should be advised. Farmers are advised to complete the sowing of Rabi crops like Mustard, Chickpea, Groundnut, Green gram/Black Gram etc. and start land preparation for nursery sowing of Rabi Paddy where irrigation facilities are available.
