   "general_advisory": "According to the forecast received from the IMD, farmers can now resume intercultural operations, fertilization and spraying of plant protection chemical with sticker as required. Considering the realized and anticipated rainfall, farmers are advised to complete the transplanting of paddy by 15th of August. Farmers are advised not to apply fertilizer and herbicides in rice field when there is no sufficient soil moisture. Make arrangements for draining out excess water from the field of Pulses, Maize, Groundnut and vegetables. Due to the prevailing cloudy weather associated with high humidity, regular monitoring for occurrence of insects and diseases in crops is highly recommended. Install light trap in crop fields to monitor insect population so that timely control measure can be taken.",

After receding of rain water, the low temperature below 28°C and relative humidity more than 70% favours infestation of Swarming caterpillar and Yellow stem borer in rice. To manage Swarming caterpillar, first remove the weeds from the field and bunds. If crop is in Beushaning stage then complete Beushaning immediately. When the ETL reaches '1' damaged tiller/hill or '2' larvae/M2, spray Chlorpyriphos 50% + Cypermethrin 5% E.C @ 400-ml/acre or Quinalphos 20% E.C. + Cypermethrin 3% E.C. @ 400-ml/acre or Lambda Cyhalothrin 5% EC @ 300 ml/acre during afternoon hours. To manage stem borer in paddy at early stage of crop, apply Cartap Hydrochloride 4% G @ 8-kg/acre or Chlorantraniliprole 0.4 % GR @ 4-kg/acre or Imidacloprid 0.3% "

Use 10-12 bird perches per acre and remove them before tasselling stage. Dust mixture of sand, soil, and wooden ash inside the leaf whorl so that the caterpillars cannot feed on the leaves. To manage the pest chemically, spray Emamectin Benzoate 5% S.G @ 80-gram/acre or Spinetoram 11.7% S.C @ 100-ml/acre or Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% S.C @ 80-ml/acre by mixing in 200-liter of water."

To manage the pest, remove the affected terminal shoot showing bore holes and the affected fruits. To manage this insect, install 8 nos. of pheromone trap having Leucin Lure per acre. Use chemical control if there is 4% withering of terminal shoot or 14% fruits infested with borers. For chemical control spray Emamectin Benzoate 5% SG @ 80-gram/acre or Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC @80-ml/acre or Spinetoram 117 % SC @ 200-ml /acre. There should be a gap of 7-10 days between pesticide application and harvest. Use any of the above insecticides alternately at 15-days interval."
