Farmers are advised to provide necessary irrigation at this stage to avoid water stress condition. Farmers are advised to install 'T' shaped bird perches in and around crop fields like chickpea, green gram, groundnut and vegetables for controlling insect population. Install pheromone trap @ 3-4/acre for monitoring borer insect in vegetables like brinjal, cauliflower, cabbage, tomato, etc. Rouging of viral infested plants should be done in vegetables. Infected plants should be uprooted and buried in the soil.",
