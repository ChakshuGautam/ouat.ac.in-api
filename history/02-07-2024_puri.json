Harvest vegetables, ripened mangoes and other fruits. Repair water harvesting structure, field bunds to store excess rainwater for utilization in case of early or mid-season droughts. For paddy cultivation, always use certified seeds. Germination test is advisable before sowing. Incorporate the dhaincha green manuring crop at the time of initial puddling of the main field. Do not apply fertilizer & pesticides until clear weather.",

Keep row to row spacing at 60 cm and plant to plant at 20 cm. To maintain optimum plant population, use seed drill for sowing or sow the seeds behind the plough. Apply 55 kg of DAP and 22-kg of potash as basal fertilizer.
