   "general_advisory": "Go for harvesting of rice at physiological maturity stage to avoid lodging and germination in the field itself. Make provision for draining out rain water in standing rice crop by making alleys (Pahi) and keep the drain ends open. Go for threshing of the harvested paddy. After threshing, paddy grains need to be sun-dried to 14% moisture for consumption purpose and for seed purpose it should be dried to 12% moisture for better shelf-life. Rodent infestation has been found in the threshing floor and in the field itself. Use poison bait. For the preparation of 100 g poison bait mix 96 g flour, 2 g edible oil and 2 g Zinc phosphide. Keep water in earthen bowl near the poison bait. Keep one celphos tablet in the mouth of each rat hole. Use 'Super Grain Bag' for safe storage of paddy/rice for a longer period of time or store the harvested paddy properly bagged and stacked with a suitable cover to avoid damage due to untimely rain. Start field preparation for green gram and black gram where irrigation facilities are available, grow Rabi crops like groundnut, Cowpea in medium/shallow lowlands utilizing the available soil moisture in the field.",

            "The transplanted paddy is at hard dough to harvesting (thirteen to seventeen week) stage. The direct seeded rice crop is at harvesting stage. Drain out water from the crop field at maturity stage. Keep the harvested paddy by covering or carry to covered threshing floor . Cut Worm: Spray Chloropyriphos 50% + Cypermethrin 5% E.C. @ 400 ml or Profenophos 50% E.C. @ 400 ml per acre per 200 ltr of water in afternoon hour . Brown Plant Hopper: BPH may be seen in the prevailing weather conditions. To Manage BPH in rice fields make alley paths after every 8-10 rows, spraying of Buprofezin+Acephate @ 30 gram or Dinotefuran @ 5 gram per 15 litres of water can be beneficial.",
            "If population of Brown Plant Hopper (BPH) exceeds economic threshold level (ETL) (i.e., 5-10 hoppers/hill), it is advised to alter the micro-climate of the rice field by alternate wetting and drying technique (water should not stand in the field for a long time). If the problem still persists, spray Pymetrozine 50% WG @ 120 g/acre or Dinotefuran 20 % SG @ 80 g/acre or Flonicamid 50 % WG @ 60- gram/acre or Triflumezopyrim 10% SC @ 100 ml / acre at the base of the plant for control of above pests. Avoid using nitrogenous fertilizers during infestation of BPH. To control Neck Blast diseases first drain out excess water from the paddy field. Spray Hexaconazole @ 400-ml/acre or Azoxystrobin+ Difenoconazole @ 200-ml/acre or Tebuconazole + Trifloxystrobin @ 80-gram/acre."

Pulverize the beds, remove the weeds and apply 1 to 2 baskets of FYM/ bed. Because of small size seeds, mix some coarse sands with the seeds for easy and uniform sowing. After sowing cover the seeds with the thin layer of soil and cover it with straw followed by light irrigation. Remove the straw after emergence."

Use 4 kg seeds/acre for high yielding varieties for rainfed condition, 3.5 kg for irrigated condition, 2-2.5 kg seeds/acre for hybrid varieties under rainfed condition and 1.5-2 kg seeds for irrigated condition. Before sowing treat the seeds with 2 g Carbendazim/kg seeds. To protect the crop from fungal wilt, treat the seeds with 4 g Trichoderma/kg. Soak the seeds for 10-12 hours for better germination. Use 600 g PSB culture per acre after draining out the water. Apply 2 ton FYM along with 8:16:12 kg NPK per acre for high yielding varieties and double it for hybrid varieties before sowing. Sow the seeds 30 cm apart maintaining a row spacing of 45 cm for loamy soil and 60 cm for clayey soil."
