   "general_advisory": "Seedling treatment with 0.2% Chloropyriphos for 10-12 hours to control stemborer in the main field if granular insecticides have not been applied previously in the nursery. Complete the transplanting of 3-5 week old seedlings in well puddled soil at a spacing of 15cm Ã— 15cm with 3-4 seedlings per hill at shallow depth. In bacterial blight endemic areas, dip the seedling roots in 0.1% (1g in one litre of water) Plantomycin solution before transplanting for 30 minutes. Apply (DAP 44 kg + MOP 22 kg) or (Urea 22 kg + SSP 125 kg + MOP 22 kg) as basal dose during final puddling. Farmers those have already completed transplanting, apply granular herbicide Bensulfuron-methyl + Pretilachlor @ 4kg/acre at 5-8 days after transplanting. In just transplanted field put 3 pheromone traps with 5mg lure/acre in the rice field for monitoring of the yellow stem borer and leaf folder. Rabi crop needs 10-15 irrigations at 7-10 days interval depending upon the soil moisture condition. Sugarcane crop is a heavy feeder. Apply 87-kg of DAP, 20-kg of MOP and 4-tonne of FYM at the time of planting in trenches. Top dressing with Urea @ 60-kg per acre each at 45, 75 and 105 days after planting should be done. To manage early and late leaf blight in tomato, spray Mancozeb 75% WP @ 600 gram/acre or Zineb 75% WP @ 500 gram/acre at 7 days interval.",

If only broadleaf weeds and sedges are dominant in the field, spray ready mix Metsulfuron methyl 10%+ Chlorimuron ethyl 10% WP @ 8gram/acre at 20-25 DAT by mixing in 200 liters of water."
