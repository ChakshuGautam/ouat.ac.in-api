Whenever the number of male moths/trap reaches 4 or 5 apply Azadirachtin 0.15% EC @ 800 ml/acre or Chlorantraniliprole 0.4% GR @ 4 kg/acre mixing with sand at 1:1 ratio or spray Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC @ 60 ml/acre in 200 litres of water or Cartap hydrochloride 4G @10kg/acre.",
            "Main field land preparation should be done by puddling the field twice at 7-10 days intervals and land leveling for uniform crop stand. About 0.8t/acre of well decomposed FYM may be applied before first puddling. Incorporate the dhaincha green manuring crop at the time of initial puddling of the main field.",
            "For high yielding varieties apply 35 kg of DAP + 27 kg of MOP or 18 kg of urea + 100kg of SSP + 27kg MOP per acre as basal dose at the time last puddling. In sandy soil apply 35 kg of DAP and 13.5 kg of MOP or 18 kg of urea + 100 kg of SSP + 13.5 kg of MOP per acre as basal dose. For hybrids, apply 53 kg of DAP + 27 kg of MOP or 26kg of urea + 150kg of SSP + 27kg MOP as basal dose at the time of final puddling.",

Before sowing, seeds should be treated with fungicides and insecticides to protect them from seed and soil-borne diseases and some insect-pests. In the kharif season crop, it is always desirable to go for raised bed planting to protect the crop from waterlogging.",
            "15-45 days period after sowing is critical for weed growth so two manual hoeing at 15 and 30 DAS and pre-emergence application of atrazine 50% WP @ 400 g ai/acre (0-2DAS) followed by one hand weeding at 35-40 days should be advised for good weed control.",
