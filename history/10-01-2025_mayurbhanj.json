Clean harvested seeds should be dried under direct sunlight to bring the moisture content below 10-12% for safe storage. Dal processing should be done in composite mini dal mill. To avoid storage pests’ infestation during storage smearing of seeds should be done with edible oil @ 250 ml/ Quintal of seeds.
