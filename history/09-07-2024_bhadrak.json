For Kharif paddy cultivation, use good quality seeds like -for Medium land -use Salandi,Kaling dhan - 1301,Pratikhya (120 -130 days) ,for shallow medium land -Swarna,Ranidhan,Mrunalini,MTU -1140,Kaling Dhan 1401 ,for Low land - Kaling Dhan 1502,Kalachampa,Kaling Dhan -1501,CR -1009 (140 -145 days) , for Flood affected area - Swarna sub 1,CR -1009 Sub 1. 2. Prevailing periodically cloudy and sunny condition is favourable for insect pest attack in vegetable crops, so its regular monitoring should be advised. 3. Prevailing weather condition may increase the chances of BLB & Blast in nursery stage in paddy, so Tricyclazole @1g/li or Plantomycin @ 1 gm/li recommended.",
