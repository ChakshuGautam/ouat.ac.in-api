Farmers should start nursery bed preparation for kharif paddy and vegetable crops and also start planting new fruit crops in orchard by taking the advantage of past rainfall condition. Prevailing weather condition is favorable for mealy bug attack in all type of crops so farmers should spray Thiamethoxam 25% WG @ 0.5-0.6g or Imidacloprid 17.8 % SL @ 0.5ml or Lambda Cyhalothrin 4.9 % CS per liter of water to control this insects under clear weather condition. Cloudy weather along with high relative humidity may favour some disease infestation in standing crop so its regular monitoring should be advised.",

All Phosphorus and Potash and 1/4th of Nitrogen should be applied as basal and rest amount of nitrogen should be applied in 2 splits.",
            "Farmers those are already done sowing, advised to thin weaker plants in the cotton field at 10-12 days after germination and gap filling is done with planting of seedlings raised in polythene bags. Keep the field weed free up to 60 days after sowing."

The drainage ditch around the shed should be clear/clean to avoid flies, insect pest attack and if possible, pesticides should be applied regularly to control flies and insects in the poultry farm. In the roofs, the side overhangs should be minimum 3 to 4 ft to prevent entry of direct rain water into the shed. Deworming and vaccination of poultry birds against ranikhet disease must be ensured."
