Apply sprinkler irrigation for heat effect. Irrigate maize adequately. Spread polythene in irrigation channels for water savings. Apply Streptocyclin in tomato and brinjal. Mulch coconut leaves and cover vegetable seedlings. Harvest fingerlings in shallow ponds. For crops like sugarcane and brinjal, specific advice is provided for disease and pest management.",
