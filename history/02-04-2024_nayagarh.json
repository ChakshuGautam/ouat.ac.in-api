Mulch coconut leaves around tree. Cover vegetable seedlings. Harvest fingerlings in shallow ponds if water temperature rises. Manage yellow stem borer in paddy. Manage blast disease. Manage tobacco caterpillar. Manage early shoot borer in Sugarcane. Manage brinjal shoot and fruit borer. Prevent whitefly infestation in okra. Store well-dried onions. Control mango hopper.
