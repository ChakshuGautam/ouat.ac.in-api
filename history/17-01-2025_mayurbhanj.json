Monitor the crops and vegetables, if symptoms are noticed, undertake appropriate plant protection measures. Carry out weeding, hoeing and other intercultural operations in Rabi vegetables. In Cole crops irrigation should be done at 7-8 Days interval depending upon soil moisture and weather condition. In winter during cold hours farmers should keep doors, windows and open spaces in cow sheds covered with polythene or gunny bag curtains to prevent direct contact to cold air. For maintaining the heat in the poultry shed during winter season, install heaters in the shed.",
