Minimum temperature (night temperature) is very likely to be 12-16°C over the districts of Coastal Odisha and adjoining districts of Interior Odisha, 10-12°C over some parts of Interior Odisha and 8-10°C over remaining parts of Interior Odisha during that period. Looking to the prevailing fog and minimum temperature conditions, farmers are advised to make provision to protect the crop as well as animals from cold. If possible, cover young fruit plants by using sarkanda grass, dry corn stalks, or gunny sacks to cover small plants, keep the southeast side open to allow sunlight and airflow, and apply light irrigation in the field to maintain soil temperature. Vaccination should be avoided in animals during foggy days and cold wave period.",

            "If infestation of seedling blight is noticed, spray Carbendazim @ 400 g/acre or Propiconazole @ 200 g/acre in 200 litres of water.",
            "Transplanting of 3-5 week old seedlings should be advised in well puddled soil at a spacing of 15 cm × 15 cm with 3-4 seedlings per hill at shallow depth. Apply (DAP 44 kg + MOP 22 kg) or (Urea 22 kg + SSP 125 kg + MOP 22 kg) as basal dose during final puddling."
