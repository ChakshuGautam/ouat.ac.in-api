   "general_advisory": "The mean maximum daily temperature was 31.7°C and the mean minimum daily temperature was 18.1°C of the Gajapati district during the last week. The district received no rainfall during the last week. Based on the five-day weather forecast of IMD, farmers are advised to undertake necessary agricultural activities, including weeding, fertilization, irrigation, harvesting and pesticide application. Undertake sowing of rabi crops like green Gram, Black gram, Toria, Chick pea, Lentil, Sunflower, Groundnut, Cowpea, Field pea etc. in medium or shallow low land to utilize the available soil moisture in the field. Rouging of viral infested crop should be done in chilli, tomato & brinjal. Infected plants should be uprooted and buried in the soil. Pulses like lentil/black gram/green gram can be broadcasted in the standing matured crop (Rice) one week before harvesting to utilize the residual moisture in the soil in suitable areas. Spraying or dusting of plant protection chemicals should be done in a clear weather condition and rainy days should be avoided.",

         "advisory": [
            "In early maturing varieties, harvest the crop when 80-85% of the grains are matured either manually by sickle or by using combine harvester or reaper. Paddy grains need to be sun-dried to 14% moisture content for consumption purpose and for seed purpose it should be dried to 12% moisture for better shelf-life. Drain out the water from paddy field, 15 days before harvesting the crop. Store the harvested paddy in a Super Grain bag for retaining the quality texture, colors, aroma, fragrance, and taste of the commodities for a longer period of time in a safer place (properly stacked with a suitable cover) to avoid damage. To control earhead caterpillar, spray Chlorpyriphos 50% + Cypermethrin 5% EC @ 400 ml/acre or Profenophos 50% EC @ 400 ml/acre. As the pest is nocturnal in behavior, spraying of pesticide should be done in the evening hours for better results."

To control boll worm complex in cotton, spray 80g Emamectin Benzoate 5% SG or Chlorantraniliprole 60ml 18.5% SC mixing with 200 liters of water per acre. Harvest cotton from bursted bolls and keep the harvested produce in a safe place to protect from rain damage."

Additionally, treat the pond with potassium permanganate @ 1-2 kg per acre or limestone @ 50-100 kg per acre. Applying salt at 100 kg per acre is also effective in protecting fish from disease outbreaks during the winter months."
