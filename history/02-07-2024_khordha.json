Harvest vegetables, ripened mangoes and other fruits. Repair water harvesting structures, field bunds to store excess rainwater for utilization in case of early or mid-season droughts. For paddy cultivation, always use certified seeds. Germination test is advisable before sowing. Incorporate the dhaincha green manuring crop at the time of initial puddling of the main field. Do not apply fertilizer & pesticides until clear weather.",
