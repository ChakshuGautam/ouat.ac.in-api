Farmers are advised to transplant 30-45 days old vegetable seedlings like chilli, tomato, capsicum, cabbage, cauliflower, brinjal etc. in the main field. Rouging of viral infested crop should be done in chilli, tomato & brinjal. Infected plants should be uprooted and buried in the soil. Now is the suitable time for sowing mustard, sarson, sunflower, field pea, carrot, radish etc. So, farmers are advised to act accordingly. Pulses like lentil/black gram/green gram can be broadcasted in the standing matured crop (Rice) one week before harvesting to utilize the residual moisture in the soil in suitable areas. Apply 20-25 kg DAP + 10 kg MoP per acre as basal before sowing Mustard.",

Store the seed cotton obtained from the 1st picking separately for getting better price. Foliar spray of liquid fertilizers like NPK-19-19-19 should be done @ 20 g/10 liters of water for better plant growth and boll development.

Paddy grains need to be sun-dried to 14% moisture content for consumption purpose and for seed purpose it should be dried to 12% moisture for better self-life. Pest Management: Gundhi bug: In prevailing weather condition, infestation of Gundhi bug may notice during milking stage. If more than 2 adults/hill is noticed, Chlorpyriphos 20% EC @ 400 ml or apply Chloropyriphos 20% EC @ 400 ml/acre or Imidacloprid 06% + Lambda-cyhalothrin 04% SL @ 120 ml/acre as foliar spray mixed with 200 liters of water."
