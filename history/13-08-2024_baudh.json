Spraying of insecticide and herbicide should be done under no rainfall condition when the sky is clear with normal wind speed. Prevailing weather condition is favorable for various disease and insect attacks in different crops, so its regular monitoring should be advised. Farmers are advised to store rainwater by making broad and elevated bunds for future use during dry spells.",

For hybrids use 1-2 seedlings per hill. Maintain 5cm of water in paddy field for better plant growth.",
