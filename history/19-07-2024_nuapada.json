In view of the above forecast, farmers advised to avoid the application of fertilizers and pesticides in standing crops until receding of rainfall. Make arrangements for draining out excess water from the field of Maize, Arhar, Groundnut, and vegetables. Harvest the matured vegetables before the impending rain.
