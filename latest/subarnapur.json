Looking to the dry weather condition in upcoming days farmers are advised to provide one irrigation in crop field and conduct all kind of spraying and intercultural operations in standing crop fields. Farmers should keep their field weed-free for proper crop growth.

Whenever the number of male moths in trap reaches 4 or 5, spraying of Azadiractin 0.15% neem seed kernel based EC formulation @ 800ml/acre should be advised. Farmers may also broadcast granular insecticide Chlorantraniliprole 4% GR @ 4kg/acre or Cartap hydrochloride 4G @ 10kg/acre mixing with sand at 1:1 ratio or spray Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC @ 60ml/acre in 200 litres of water to control these insects."
