There is a chance of increase in various disease infestations in both field as well as vegetable crops due to prevailing weather conditions so regular monitoring against these diseases should be advised. Farmers are advised to complete the sowing of Rabi crops like Mustard, Chickpea, Groundnut, Green gram/Black Gram etc. and start land preparation for nursery sowing of Rabi Paddy where irrigation facilities are available. Deworming and vaccination should be advised in animals to boost immunity and protect them from any harmful diseases.",

After harvesting, rice should be dried in the field for 2-3 days and thereafter threshing should be done. Rice should be stored at a moisture level of 12% in safe places.",

If infestation is noticed, then spraying of Copper hydroxide 77% @ 2g/ltr or Tebuconazole 25% @ 2g/ltr should be advised. Repeat the spray after 7-10 days for its effective control."

For 10 kg of seed, farmer can use 200 grams of rhizobium culture and 200 grams of phospho culture within 3 hours of sowing. 40 to 50 kg of seed or 60 to 70 kg of pod is required per acre. Seeds should be sown within 2 to 3 days of husking at a depth of 5 cm. If the seedlings are of 10 days old, it is recommended to conduct gap filling where the seedlings have not emerged."
