There is a chance of occurrence of cloudy weather along with very light rain after three days of the upcoming week and beginning of the next week so farmers are advised to take proper care during spraying operations. Mulching should be done with crop residue, straw/polythene to conserve soil moisture as well as maintain soil temperature. Prevailing weather condition is favorable for increasing the population of different diseases and insects in crop fields so its regular monitoring should be advised. Avoid grazing/feeding of cattle during noon hours because there is a chance of an increase in the maximum temperature in upcoming days.",
