            "After noticing the infestation of the stored grain insect pest, take up fumigation by using Aluminium phosphide (do not use in dwelling houses) tablets @ of 3 tablets/ton grain (total 9g of tablets) in fairly air tight containers or by covering with thick tarpaulin leaving no gaps. The tablets should be wrapped in cotton pouches before placing them in the stacks. All the corners of plastic cover should be plastered with 6-inch thick layer of mud/adhesive tapes to prevent leakage of gas. Minimum exposure period is for about 7-10 days."

If attack observed, then at initial stage spraying of Azadiractin or neem-based insecticide 1500 ppm @ 600 ml in 200 liters of water per acre. Use 8 yellow sticky traps per acre. Trichogramma chilonis cards @ 1-2 nos. per acre can also be used at one week interval. Cut the card into 12 pieces at the designated place. For chemical management, apply 40 grams of thiamethoxam or 80 grams of Emamectin benzoate per acre in 200 liters of water.
