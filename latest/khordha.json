   "general_advisory": "Transplanting of vegetables should be done in afternoon hour to avoid high temperature. In case of ear cutting caterpillar incidence in paddy, spray Quinalphos or Chlorpyriphos. After harvesting, Blackgram and Greengram, dry the seeds until the optimum moisture content is attained. At the time of harvesting groundnut pods usually have moisture content around 40-50% and hence need to be dried under direct sunlight to bring moisture content below 10%. Cover the rows with dry leaves in Sugarcane. Apply sprinkler irrigation to bring down the heat effect. High temperature in day hours may lead to wilting in tomato and brinjal. Mulch coconut leaves around a coconut tree to reduce water loss.",
