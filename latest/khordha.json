Now beushaning can be performed where rainfall was adequate. In heavy rainfall areas, stop the sowing of seeds and top dressing of fertilisers or herbicides for the time being. Nursery sowing should be completed by the end of the 2nd fortnight of July. If infestation of thrips is noticed in the rice nursery, spray NSKE (Azadirachtin) @ 800 ml/acre or Lambda-Cyhyalothrin 5% EC @ 100 ml/acre or Thiamethoxam 25% WG @ 40g/acre. In case of seedling blight disease appearance, apply Propiconazole @ 1 ml/litre of water. Make provisions for drainage where maize or pulses etc. have been sown. Cover the vegetable nursery with polythene to protect it from heavy rain and make drainage arrangements.",
