Complete the transplanting of 3-5 week old seedlings in well puddled soil at a spacing of 15cm x 15cm with 3-4 seedlings per hill at shallow depth. In bacterial blight endemic areas, dip the seedling roots in 0.1% Plantomycin solution before transplanting. Apply recommended basal doses during final puddling. Apply granular herbicide for farmers who have completed transplanting. Set up pheromone traps for monitoring pests. Follow irrigation schedule depending on soil moisture conditions. Apply recommended fertilizers and manage pest and disease control based on crop specifics.",
