For soil moisture conservation and avoid evaporation losses mulching practices should be followed. Avoid grazing of animal during noon hours in open place because there is a chance of increase in maximum temperature in upcoming days. To Enhance pollination in crops, provide 20% Boron @300gm/acre by mixing 200 l of water. Farmers should observe the pest and disease incidence on their field and if the infestation is above economic threshold level (ETL) then spraying of insecticide and pesticide should be done in morning hours.",
