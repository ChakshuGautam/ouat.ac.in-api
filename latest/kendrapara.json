In case of ear cutting caterpillar incidence in paddy, spray Quinalphos 25EC or Chlorpyriphos 20EC. After harvesting, dry the seeds until the optimum moisture content is attained. At the time of harvesting groundnut pods, usually have moisture content around 40-50% and hence need to be dried under direct sunlight. Apply sprinkler irrigation to bring down the heat effect.",
