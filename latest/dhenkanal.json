Use low-cost polythene cover above the vegetables nursery to avoid poor germination due to low temperature. Transplanting of 25-30 days old paddy seedlings should be done at a spacing of 20x15 cm, plant 2 seedlings per hill for high yielding varieties. To control bacterial blight in paddy, dip the seedling roots in 0.1% Plantomycin solution before transplanting for 30 minutes.",
