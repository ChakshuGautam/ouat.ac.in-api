Summer ploughing should be done in the field across the slope with specialized tools for opening the soil crust and overturning the soil to kill the weeds and recharge the soil during the pre-monsoon showers. Make field bunds to conserve water in the field. Prepare the beds for nursery management and further transplanting.",
