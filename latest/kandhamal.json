Farmers should halt sowing seeds like maize to prevent rotting and germination failure or they can sow the seeds by making the ridge. Drain out excess water from vegetable fields to protect the seedlings from rotting. Chickens and cattle should be provided with a dry environment in the prevailing rainy season.",
