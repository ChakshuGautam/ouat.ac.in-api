In fallow uplands, utilizing recent rainfall, farmers should take up short-duration low water-requiring crops like black gram, green gram, sesame, fodder crops, etc. Regular surveillance work should be taken up in all crops to know the incidence of various insect pests and initiate the control strategies. Due to high humidity, there are possibilities of pest and disease buildup in already sown crops. Take plant protection measures depending on the crop and weather conditions.",
