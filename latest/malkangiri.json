Farmers are advised to do proper arrangement for storing rainwater at one portion in the field. This water can be used for irrigation in the crops during a dry spell. Go for field preparation for non-paddy crops like pulse, oilseeds, and vegetables in upland condition and take up early sowing/transplanting. Due to high humidity possibilities of pest and disease build up in already sown crop. Take plant protection measures depending on the crop and weather condition.",
