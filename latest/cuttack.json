   "general_advisory": "In paddy crop, Panicle initiation, Panicle emergence, flowering, and milking stages are the critical stages. Cover the rows with dry leaves in sugarcane. Apply sprinkler irrigation to bring down the heat effect. High temperature increases the water requirement of maize crop. Spread polythene in irrigation channels to save water wastage. Apply Streptocyclin in tomato and brinjal if wilting occurs. Mulch coconut leaves around the tree to reduce water loss. Cover vegetable seedlings with paper caps. Harvest fingerlings from shallow ponds if the water temperature rises. For onion, cut the tops after harvesting and dry the bulbs in a well-ventilated room. Use specific insecticides for crop management.",
