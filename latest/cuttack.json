In these stages, water scarcity or deficit of water causes a comparatively greater reduction in yields. Hence, water deficit during these stages should be avoided. Cover the rows with dry leaves in Sugarcane. Top-dress with 4% potassium to protect the crop from water scarcity during summer. Apply sprinkler irrigation to bring down the heat effect. Conserve up to 50% water by irrigating alternate rows.",
