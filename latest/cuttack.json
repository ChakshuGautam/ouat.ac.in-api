Cover the rows with dry leaves in Sugarcane. Apply sprinkler irrigation to reduce heat effects. Irrigate maize crop adequately. Spread polythene in irrigation channels. Apply specific treatments for high temperature issues in tomato, brinjal, and coconut. Harvest fingerlings in shallow ponds if water temperature rises. Manage Yellow Stem Borer and Blast Disease in paddy. Control Tobacco Caterpillar in black gram and green gram. Manage early shoot borer in Sugarcane. Control Brinjal shoot and fruit borer. Prevent whitefly infestation in okra seeds. Properly manage onions after harvesting. Control Mango hopper in Mango.",
