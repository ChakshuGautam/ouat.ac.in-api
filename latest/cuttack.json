Cover the rows with dry leaves in sugarcane and top-dress with 4% potassium. Apply sprinkler irrigation and conserve water by irrigating alternate rows. Irrigate the maize crop as required. Spread polythene in irrigation channels for efficient water usage. Take measures to prevent wilting in tomato and brinjal. Implement appropriate measures for different crops like mulching coconut leaves, covering vegetable seedlings, and maintaining proper water temperature for fingerlings.",
