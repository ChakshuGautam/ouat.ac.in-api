Apply Streptocyclin in tomato and brinjal. Mulch coconut leaves. Cover with paper caps on newly planted vegetable seedlings. Harvest fingerlings in shallow ponds. Yellow stem borer management in paddy. Blast disease management in paddy. Tobacco caterpillar management in black gram & green gram. Early shoot borer management in sugarcane. Brinjal shoot and fruit borer management. Whitefly infestation prevention in okra. Post-harvesting advice for onion. Mango hopper control in mango.",
