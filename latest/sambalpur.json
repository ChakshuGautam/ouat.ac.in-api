Minimum temperature (night temperature) is very likely to be 12-16°C over the districts of Coastal Odisha and adjoining districts of Interior Odisha, 10-12°C over some parts of Interior Odisha and 8-10°C over remaining parts of Interior Odisha during that period. Looking to the prevailing fog and minimum temperature condition, farmers are advised to make provision to protect the crop as well as animal from cold. If possible, cover young fruit plants by using sarkanda grass, dry corn stalks, or gunny sacks to cover small plants, keep the southeast side open to allow sunlight and airflow and apply light irrigation in field to maintain soil temperature. Vaccination should be avoided in animal during foggy days and cold wave period.",
