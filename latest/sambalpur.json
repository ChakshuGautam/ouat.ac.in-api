Apply light and frequent irrigation to the standing crops, increase the frequency of irrigation at critical growth stages, irrigate only during the evening or early morning and use sprinkler irrigation if possible. Mulching should be done with crop residue, straw/polythene to conserve soil moisture as well as maintain soil temperature. Avoid grazing of animals during noon hours in open place because there is a chance of increase in maximum temperature in upcoming days. Past weather condition is favourable for increasing the population of various insects and diseases in both field as well as vegetable crops so its regular monitoring should be advised.",
