Use 24-30 kg of paddy seeds/acre for broadcasting and 12-16 kg seeds/acre for sowing by seed drill depending on the test weight of the seed. Incorporate the dhaincha green manuring crop at the time of initial puddling of the main field. Apply full dose of Phosphorus and Potash as per recommendations. Arhar can be grown as an intercrop in groundnut for more profit and soil health management. Treat okra seeds to provide resistance against pests. Ensure proper soil moisture before sowing. Preferably sow paddy seeds in line spacing using seed drill for optimal growth.",
