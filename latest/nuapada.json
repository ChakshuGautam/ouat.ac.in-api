   "general_advisory": "As per extended range of forecast received from IMD, fairly widespread to widespread rain/thundershower is very likely over districts of Odisha during next week (2nd to 8th August 2024) and overall rainfall activity likely to be slightly above normal with possibility of isolated heavy to very heavy rain over the districts of Odisha during next week. In view of above forecast, farmers advised to withhold intercultural operation, top dressing and application of pesticides for next three days. Considering the realized and anticipated rainfall, farmers are advised to complete the transplanting of paddy where the field has been ready. Make arrangements for draining out excess water from the field of pulses, maize, groundnut, and vegetables. Prepare bund for conserving rainwater inside the field, specifically in upland conditions. Due to the prevailing cloudy weather associated with high humidity, regular monitoring for the occurrence of insects and diseases in crops is highly recommended. SMS Advisory: Always apply the recommended dose of pesticides by following necessary safety measures.",
