   "general_advisory": "Very light to light rain is in the forecast on coming Monday & Tuesday. So, farmers are advised to withhold irrigation and spraying of chemicals for the time being. Farmers are advised to install “T” shaped bird perches in and around crop field like Chickpea, Green gram, Groundnut, and vegetables for controlling insect population. Install pheromone trap @ 3-4/acre for monitoring borer insect in vegetables like brinjal, cauliflower, cabbage, tomato etc. Rouging of viral infested plant should be done in vegetables. Infected plants should be uprooted and buried in the soil. After rouging, if infection is more than spraying of Imidacloprid @ 0.3 ml per litre of water is advised to control the vector. Install yellow sticky trap @ 8/acre to monitor sucking pest like White fly, Aphids, Jassids & Thirps in vegetative stage. To prevent sucking pests neem-based pesticide (1500 ppm) may be sprayed @ 3 ml/lit of water or to control chemically, apply Thiamethoxam 25 WG @ 0.2 g/lit or Imidacloprid 17.8% SL @ 0.25 ml/lit of water. To control black spot disease in Rose spray Copper Oxy-chloride 50% WP @ 3g/ltr of water. To control inflorescence rotting in Merigold spray Mancozeb 75% WP @ 2g or Carbendazim 50% WP @ 1g by mixing with one liter of water. Vaccinate animals against FMD, BQ, HS, PPR & Goat Pox.",
