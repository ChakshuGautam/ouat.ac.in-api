In view of above forecast farmers advised to avoid the application of fertilizers and pesticides in standing crops until receding of rainfall. Make arrangements for draining out excess water from the field of Maize, Arhar, Groundnut and vegetables. Harvest the matured vegetable before the impending rain. Protect the vegetable seedlings in nursery from heavy rain by covering with plastic or polythene sheet over the nursery bed.",
