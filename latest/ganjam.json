After harvesting of onion, cut the tops leaving 2.0-2.5 cm above bulb for longer storage. Summer sunflower crop is at pre-flowering stage. Monitor the emergence of Tobacco Caterpillar adult moths. To prevent whitefly infestation in okra seeds should be treated with Imidacloprid. Manage Yellow Stem Borer in paddy. Manage Blast Disease. For Tobacco Caterpillar Management in black gram and green gram. Manage early Shoot Borer in sugarcane. Manage Brinjal shoot and fruit borer. Manage Yellow mosaic viral disease in okra.
