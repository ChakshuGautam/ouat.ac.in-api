   "general_advisory": "For one-acre area of paddy transplanting 400 m2 (10 Decimal) size of land is required for nursery raising. Before sowing, paddy seeds should be treated with Trichoderma powder formulation@10g/kg of seeds or any other seed treating chemicals like Thiram 75% @ 3 gm or Captan 50% @ 3 gm per kg of seeds procured from the Government approved agencies. Go for non-paddy crops in the upland to avoid terminal drought. Intercropping of cereals+pulses/oilseeds is recommended. Go for early sowing/transplanting as for as possible to complete these by mid-August. Go for medium duration rice varieties in medium land. Go for line sowing of rice followed by early beaushaning and weeding. This will avoid the rainfall required for transplanting, and over -aged seedlings if transplanted late.",

            "In assured irrigated areas select the land for wet bed nursery close to source of irrigation water with good drainage facilities. It is advisable to follow community nursery approach at village level. Divide nursery area into smaller plots of 1.5-metre-long, 10 cm height and convenient length. Irrigation channels of size 30 cm in width should be made along the beds for irrigation/drainage.
