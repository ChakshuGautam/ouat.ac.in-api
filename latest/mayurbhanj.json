   "general_advisory": "For one-acre area of paddy transplanting 400 m2 (10 Decimal) size of land is required for nursery raising. Before sowing, paddy seeds should be treated with Trichoderma powder formulation@10g/kg of seeds or any other seed treating chemicals like Thiram 75% @ 3 gm or Captan 50% @ 3 gm per kg of seeds procured from the Government approved agencies. Go for non-paddy crops in the upland to avoid terminal drought. Intercropping of cereals+pulses/oilseeds is recommended. Go for early sowing/transplanting as for as possible to complete these by mid-August. Go for medium duration rice varieties in medium land. Go for line sowing of rice followed by early beaushaning and weeding. This will avoid the rainfall required for transplanting, and over -aged seedlings if transplanted late.",

It is advisable to follow community nursery approach at village level. Divide nursery area into smaller plots of 1.5-metre-long, 10 cm height and convenient length. Irrigation channels of size 30 cm in width should be made along the beds for irrigation/drainage. Sprouted Seeds should be sown @ 40-50 g/ m2 area of seed bed by line sowing with 5 cm gap between each line or direct broadcasting and put dried compost over seeds."

Keep row to row spacing at 60 cm and plant to plant at 20 cm. To maintain optimum plant population, use seed drill for sowing or sow the seeds behind the plough. Apply 55 kg of DAP  and 22-kg of potash as basal fertilizer . For chemical control of weeds in Maize, spray Atrazine 50 % W.P herbicide @ 800 g /acre by mixing it in 200 litres of water within 1-2 DAS."

Land should be ploughed 3-4 times by cultivator to get fine tilth followed by land levelling. Apply 2 tonne of well decomposed FYM during final land preparation. Seed treatment can be done with Carbendazim 50 % WP @ 2- gram/ kg of seeds or Carboxin 37.5 % + Thiram 37.5% D.S WP. Treat the seeds with recommended species of Rhizobium bacterial culture @ 20 gram/kg of seeds before 1 hour of sowing.

Seed treatment can be done with Carbendazim 50 % WP @ 2g/ kg of seeds or Carboxin 37.5 % + Thiram 37.5% D.S WP @ 3-gm/kg of seeds. After about 6 hours of seed treatment sow the seeds at 2.5 x 5cm at a depth of 1cm. After sowing, drench the soil with a mixture of 2-g Carbendazim. Cover the nursery bed with paddy straw or dried leaves for better germination.

The sand soaks the urine so that the animals can sleep over it comfortably . It is also easier to clean the faecal material over the sand floor . To keep the sand dry it is stirred upside down in 15-20 days interval. The floor space requirement for kid is 0.5, for adult 1.2, for buck and pregnant female 2 square metre floor space is necessary which is suitable for every type of shed."

Generally , a density of 5,000 fingerlings/ha is kept as a standard stocking. Groundnut oil cake and rice bran is given in same ratio @ 5% of the total biomass of stocking material. Cow dung, urea and super phosphate should be applied to increase pond quality . In 8-10 months, fishes attain their marketable size."
