   "general_advisory": "Harvest the matured paddy. If 80% of the panicles are matured, farmers can go for the harvesting. Reduce the moisture of the harvested paddy by sun drying it. Keep the threshing floor clean. Rodent- If 'Rodent/Rats' problem is noticed, locate the rodent burrow in the crop field and surrounding areas. Place Aluminium Phosphide 6% tablet @ One tablet (12 gm) per burrow and seal the burrow with mud which will kill the rodents. Powdery mildew- There is a chance of powdery mildew disease in Black gram and Green gram. To control this disease, spray Sulphur 80% WP @800 g/acre or Hexaconazole 5%. Weed management - Apply pre-emergence herbicide Oxyfluorfen 23.5% EC @ 80ml/acre or Pendimethalin 30% EC @ 1litre/acre at 1-2 DAS. Apply herbicide when the soil is moist. Red Rot disease - For controlling Red Rot disease in Sugarcane, spray Carbendazim 12%+ Mancozeb 63% WP @ 400 g/acre or Metalaxyl 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP @ 400 g/acre. Downy mildew - To control downy mildew in Pointed gourd, Spray Metalaxyl 8% + Fosetyl-AL 80% WP @ 600 g/acre. Diamond Back Moth - To manage these pests install 6-8 nos of light traps per acre. Farmers are advised to keep the water depth up to 6 feet in the winter season. Feed intake of fish decreases with decreasing temperature. Hence, it is essential to reduce the feeding rate by 75% depending on the temperature.",
