   "general_advisory": "As per Extended Range Forecast of IMD, rainfall is normal and both maximum and minimum temperature is expected to be normal for Odisha state during 14th to 20th July, 2024 so, farmers are advised to take necessary action towards kharif crop cultivation. Farmers should start main field preparation for transplanting of paddy seedlings and vegetable crops and also start planting new fruit crops in orchard by taking the advantage of prevailing rainfall conditions. Prevailing weather condition is favorable for sucking insect pests such as mealy bug, aphids etc. attack in all types of crops so farmers should spray Thiamethoxam 25% WG @ 0.5-0.6g or Imidacloprid 17.8% SL @ 0.5ml or Lambda Cyhalothrin 4.9 % CS per liter of water to control these insects. Cloudy weather along with high relative humidity may favor various disease infestations in standing crop so its regular monitoring should be advised. Farmers are advised to store the rainwater by making broad and elevated bunds for future use during any dry spells.",

            "By taking the advantage of previous rainfall farmers should start field preparation for nursery sowing of Paddy. Wet bed nursery should be selected for assured irrigated areas close to the source of irrigation water with good drainage facilities. Divide nursery area into smaller plots of 1.5-metre-long, 10-15 cm height, and convenient length. Irrigation channels of size 30 cm in width should be made along the beds for irrigation/drainage. Before sowing, seed treatment should be done with Carbendazim 50% WP @ 2g/kg of seeds or Trichoderma @ 10 g/kg of seeds. Soak the seeds in water for 24 hours and then drain out the water and keep the seeds in a gunny bag. Once the seeds sprout, use them for sowing."

Farmers should start raised bed nursery preparation for kharif vegetable crops with a proper drainage system to avoid waterlogging."
