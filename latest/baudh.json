   "general_advisory": "As per Extended Range Forecast of IMD, rainfall is above normal and both maximum and minimum temperature is expected to be normal for Odisha state during 7th to 13th July, 2024 so, farmers are advised to take necessary action towards kharif crop cultivation and avoid irrigation during that period. Farmers should start nursery bed preparation for kharif paddy and vegetable crops and also start planting new fruit crops in orchard by taking the advantage of past rainfall condition. Prevailing weather condition is favorable for mealy bug attack in all type of crops so farmers should spray Thiamethoxam 25% WG @ 0.5-0.6g or Imidacloprid 17.8 % SL @ 0.5ml or Lambda Cyhalothrin 4.9 % CS per liter of water to control this insects under clear weather condition. Cloudy weather along with high relative humidity may favor some disease infestation in standing crop so its regular monitoring should be advised.",

Wet bed nursery should be selected for assured irrigated areas close to source of irrigation water with good drainage facilities. Divide nursery area into smaller plots of 1.5-metre-long, 10-15 cm height and convenient length. Irrigation channels of size 30 cm in width should be made along the beds for irrigation/drainage.",

Farmers may use a seed rate @ 800-1500 g per acre. Before sowing, seed should be treated with imidachloprid 70 WG @ 7 g/kg of seed for protection against sucking pests. Spacing should be 90 × 45-60 cm and 90-120 × 90 cm for normal and hybrid variety respectively.",

All Phosphorus and Potash and 1/4 th of Nitrogen should be applied as basal and rest amount of nitrogen should be applied in 2 splits.",
            "Farmers those are already done sowing, advised to thin weaker plants in the cotton field at 10-12 days after germination and gap filling is done with planting of seedlings raised in polythene bags. Keep the field weed-free up to 60 days after sowing."

The drainage ditch around the shed should be clear/clean to avoid flies, insect pest attack and if possible, pesticides should be applied regularly to control flies and insects in the poultry farm. In the roofs, the side overhangs should be a minimum of 3 to 4 ft to prevent the entry of direct rainwater into the shed. Deworming and vaccination of poultry birds against ranikhet disease must be ensured."
