Water management: Now the crop is approaching to flowering stage. So flowering and grain filling stages are critical for green and black gram and water stress must be avoided during this period. Disease and Insect Management: Yellow Mosaic Virus: If infection of YMV is noticed, then infected plants should be uprooted and buried in the soil. Installation of yellow sticky trap @ 8/acre at vegetative stage is recommended or spray Thiomethoxam 25 WG @ 1g/ 5 ltr or Imidacloprid 17.8% SL @ 1.5 ml/ 5 ltr of water to monitor the vector of YMV effectively."
