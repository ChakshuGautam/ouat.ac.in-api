Farmers are advised to postpone irrigation to the standing crops by keeping in view of realized and anticipated rainfall and undertake necessary steps to remove excess water from the crop field. In view of high relative humidity due to expected rainfall along with cloudy weather, regular monitoring for incidence of insect pest should be done in standing crops and application of pesticide should be avoided for next two days keeping in view of weather forecast. Sowing of Kharif crops like Maize, Pigeon pea, Groundnut, Cotton, Green gram etc. should be completed soon after cessation of rainfall with availability of adequate soil moisture. Protect the vegetable seedlings in nursery from rain by covering with polythene or by making a shed over the nursery bed. Farmers are advised to take necessary actions to prevent rainwater entering into the animal shed.",
