Light irrigation to standing crops & vegetables during morning hours is recommended to prevent damage from fog, low temperature, and moisture stress. Cover vegetable nurseries with polythene to avoid poor germination due to low temperature. Undertake intercultural operations in vegetables to remove weeds.
