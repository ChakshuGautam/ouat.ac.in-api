Apply balanced and appropriate fertilizers according to cropâ€™s growth stage followed by irrigation. Early sown crops like green gram, black gram, chickpea, groundnut, field pea, maize etc. are at flowering stage. So, farmers are advised to provide necessary irrigation at this stage to avoid water stress condition. To control Mealybug infestation in Mango spray Profenophos 50% EC @ 2ml/ltr of water. To control Powdery mildew disease in Rose spray Carbendazim 50% WP @ 1.5 g/ltr of water. To control inflorescence rotting in Merigold spray Mancozeb 75% WP @ 2g or Carbendazim 50% WP @ 1g by mixing with one liter of water.
