Considering the realized and anticipated rainfall, farmers are advised to complete the transplanting of paddy by 15th of August. Farmers are advised not to apply fertilizer and herbicides in rice fields when there is not sufficient soil moisture. Make arrangements for draining out excess water from the fields of pulses, maize, groundnut, and vegetables. Due to the prevailing cloudy weather associated with high humidity, regular monitoring for the occurrence of insects and diseases in crops is highly recommended. Additionally, specific advisories for different crops have been provided.",
